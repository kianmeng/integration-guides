# Roadmap 2023

This is the roadmap planned by the Integration team at Meilisearch for 2023.

Nothing is definitive: the roadmap can be adapted depending on the need of the users and the company.

## 2023: the Main Lines

#### Objectives

- Create essential features in the existing SDKs, which the users highly request.
- Keep working with the community, improve our way of working with the contributors by creating more evident issues, and provide more and more "good first issues".
- Work closer to the DevRel and Docs teams to help engage new users and make them stay.
- Release at least two new integrations/tools based on the data collected by the community.
- Rework the current DevOps process and make it stable and reliable.
  - Also add the support for the most significant providers out there, which we are not present yet (Azure and Alibaba cloud)

## Q1

We're entering a new era in 2023, and now we want to achieve some goals we were unable to last year. It is time to increase our DevOps CI's reliability and take the opportunity to be present in two of the biggest cloud providers: Azure and Alibaba. Together they control 26% of the market share. This could be a good advertisement for the company and bring more users.

We are also entering a phase where new projects, not just integrations, will be requested by the team, so we must know where to spend our precious maintenance time. That's why we're going to introduce SDK tiers.

New projects:
- [ ] Add the usage support for the [autocomplete.js](https://github.com/algolia/autocomplete)
- [ ] Implement **packer.io** to build Meilisearch images for the cloud providers.

Maintenance:
- [x] Add Meilisearch engine version v1.0.0 support for the integrations and SDKs.
- [ ] Add Meilisearch engine version v0.30 support for Swift
- [ ] Add Meilisearch engine version v1.0.0 support for Swift
- [x] Add Meilisearch engine version v0.29 support for Java
- [ ] Add Meilisearch engine version v0.30 support for Java
- [ ] Add Meilisearch engine version v1.0.0 support for Java
- Changes regarding the Meilisearch release v1.1 (_TBD_)
  - [ ] Improve geo-search with `_geoBoundingBox`
  - [ ] Perform multiple index searches in a single query
  - [ ] Delete documents by a filter query

Processes:
- [ ] Introduce the versioning policy for the post-v1 era.
- [ ] Introduce the SDK tiers, to improve our time management in a transparent way.
