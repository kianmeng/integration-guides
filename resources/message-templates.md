## Message templates

These templates should be used whenever the situations written in bold happen:

**When the contributor asks to be assigned to the issue**

Hi \@username, We prefer not assigning external people to our issues.

Why? People often ask to be assigned and never return, discouraging the volunteer contributors from opening a PR to fix the issue.

We will accept and merge the first PR that fixes correctly and implements the issue following the contribution guidelines of the corresponding repository.

We are looking forward to seeing you. No need to wait for an assignment to start! :+1:

**When the contributor suggests an improvement in a low-level tier.**

Hey \@username.
I agree with implementing this!

We might need more time to work on it in the following weeks. Also, I will add some details to this issue to make the implementation easier.
If someone wants to contribute and implement it, it will be released faster! PRs are always welcome!

**When the user creates an issue that is a support**

Hey there,

We are a small team, so we can’t spend much time doing support anymore :cry:. 
You’ll have better luck by going to our support channels like Discord. Can you please try it first? 
If you can identify this as a bug, feel free to open up a new issue with a link to the original one, and we’ll gladly help you out.
